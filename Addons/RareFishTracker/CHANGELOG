Thanks to the Right Anglers fishing guild for their fishing data and their support.
Thanks also to ESOUI.com user meglon978 for the idea. Thanks to Seerah for writing
LibAddonMenu. I read ingeniousclown's Weapon Charge Alert and Biki's Achievement 
Tracker to help me resolve some UI window issues, and Achievement Tracker again to 
deal with achievement detection issues. I referenced pills's MailR to remind myself 
how to do keybinds.
